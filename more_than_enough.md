# More than enough really is too much

Joichi Ito ends their manifesto on designing a future we _want_ with machines with the paragraph:

> In the 1960s and 70s, the hippie movement tried to pull together a “whole earth” movement, but then the world swung back toward the consumer and consumption culture of today. I hope and believe that a new awakening will happen and that a new sensibility will cause a nonlinear change in our behavior through a cultural transformation. While we can and should continue to work at every layer of the system to create a more resilient world, I believe the cultural layer is the layer with the most potential for a fundamental correction away from the self-destructive path that we are currently on. I think that it will yet again be about the music and the arts of the young people reflecting and amplifying a new sensibility: a turn away from greed to a world where “more than enough is too much,” and we can flourish in harmony with Nature rather than through the control of it.  

…”more than enough is too much”.

When Ito discusses the cultural transformation he envisages, he makes a compelling case for a change on the level of human culture. But what does that look like? The hippie movement, as he rightly points out, was pretty good at bringing about change in the public consciousness, but it faded, too.

Actually. Maybe it didn’t.

The 60s and 70s saw the hippie movement spring forth, but it wasn’t born out of nowhere; it was born out of cultural change in the 50s which cemented in the public consciousness that certain changes were necessary. Influences like [responses of physicists to our newfound nuclear power](https://youtu.be/lb13ynu3Iac) and the environmentalist writing of people like [Rachel Carson]() ushered in a new relationship with the world around us: environmentalism. The hippie movement was the extreme of this which eventually faded — yes! — but the underlying current of cultural change is undeniable. 

What’s interesting to me is that this cultural change is able to cascade into changes to companies and organisations; those which eventually brought back around the consumerist culture Ito identifies as a contributing force to life becoming ever-larger, ever-richer, and ever-hungrier. The modern world attempts exponential and unregulated growth, he claims, and a cultural shift is required to change the relationship we have with organisations and their obsession with uncontrolled expansion.

Here’s the thing: to actually resist reduction requires action. I’m not trying to be facetious: writing like Ito’s is valuable, it’s a call to arms to make some kind of change — and we need the Joi Itos of the world to identify these needs! — but a call to arms isn’t worth anything if people don’t get up and stand up and _act_. Unfortunately, Resisting Reduction identifies a target, but makes no indication as to how to reach it.

The issue I have with writing like Resisting Reduction is that it’s begun to beckon more of the same. Now, the action we take on these manifestos isn’t getting up and standing up and _making change_; now the action is getting up and standing up and _agreeing_. This is fine too, but it’s easy to get into an echo chamber not where ideas are reinforced, but reiterated and built upon with no line in the sand for the group to assemble a task force and organise meaningful change.

## A line in the sand
We’ve had enough discussion about the need for cultural change, I feel, and while extra rumination like the Journal of Design and Science’s issue literally dedicated to the Resisting Reduction manifesto is all academia can really offer anyway — and we need people to identify these issues! — we also need to begin moving in some kind of _direction_, and we might as well start now.

Ideally we can identify broad methods which can be tweaked and applied for a variety of societal ills. So, let’s pick a problem, and then generalise from there; let’s look at the unregulated growth Joi Ito identified. (After all, growth of tech produces myriad issues we need to tackle, and we should start somewhere.)

_What kind of cultural change do we want to make?_ Starting from that environmentalist root, the change to our collective consciousness so embedded now that even the director of MIT’s Media Lab missed it in that manifesto, is a good place to begin. The scale of cultural change we need to make fixing Ito’s issue is _at least_ that, after all. When we think about organisations and the various other mammoth systems that dominate our lives, we shouldn’t be thinking of them as unconstrained beasts; we should be thinking of them like Ito suggests, as participants carefully balancing an ecosystem which they rely on to thrive, and which uncontrolled growth would upset.

There are movements today that we can latch onto to begin to move people’s thinking toward organisations in this ecological direction. One example that springs to mind is minimalism. Minimalism has long roots — really, the idea that living simply and with a spartan attitude to frivolous extras feels like it traces back millennia. Why, then, does “simple living” [warrant its own wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_living)?

The movement makes its headway through the cultural ether for a few reasons, I think. One is that it’s popped up at an opportune time; the internet’s boom seems to have assisted its rise. [Tiny Houses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_house_movement) would probably struggle to succeed without internet fame. But another is that it’s an extension of the environmentalist roots that we’ve been coming back to as a western culture increasingly of recent years. The idea of cutting back, of careful introspection into what’s needed and what effects things bring, the culture of removing the cause of a problem instead of adding some new fix to address its symptoms, is already embedded in the public consciousness. We can see it in minimalism’s rise. But it comes from environmentalism; of an awareness that ecologies are complex, and any ecology requires a delicate hand to balance. Constantly adding more and more fixes just isn’t right sometimes; sometimes you need to remove the cause of an issue.

<!— I think “economic ecosystems” needs to be expanded on a little bit here, for the sake of clarity; that’s an important takeaway. —>

The takeaway of Resisting Reduction is that we need cultural change around uncontrolled organisational expansion. A starting point in making that change would be to — somehow — embed the _awareness_ of this need to change, and a little of the understanding of how economic ecosystems evolve, into our cultural consciousness. Just like environmentalism did with the natural ecosystem! And environmentalism conveniently provides a toolkit in people’s heads to build on. Today, people are careful about recycling and about energy use. “Green” companies make enough of an impact that Apple now runs on 100% green energy (including their suppliers). 

This approach is a claim that the change that needs to be made is a public awareness that natural resources like plastics and energy aren’t just a finite resource, they’re _currencies_, in the systems theoretic sense. It’s a resource we can deplete, something others will compete for, and something in limited supply. This change is necessary because, once people have a concept of currencies within ecosystems, movements for people to understand systems that operate with currencies shouldn’t be as complex to engineer.

Wealth is the amount of currency a system has; power is a system’s ability to leverage that currency in order to change the systems it exists in. Ito’s systems with unregulated growth are systems which, with enough wealth, can use it for the power to gain more resources than they spend without limit or regulation.

Unfortunately, these systems which undergo uncontrolled growth become large and complex enough to have their own autonomy, and are powerful enough to manipulate the systems we try to constrain them within, effectively preventing regulation. When a we impose changes on systems, we put them under strain, but a sophisticated enough system can make the necessary adjustments to absorb our efforts. Changing copyright duration is an excellent example of this, and the economic organisms’ counters to our efforts are well recorded by people like Lawrence Lessig in [Free Culture](http://free-culture.cc). Sometimes, we succeed anyway. Despite the tobacco industry’s best efforts, there’s a cultural acceptance of the fact that smoking is bad for us.

Getting around this autonomy likely means constraining the size of the organism suitably, so in the meantime, proper education is the key driver of change here. Note that this is, effectively, the difference between a situation like copyright law and a situation like smoking’s health impact: everybody is aware that smoking can give you cancer, while few people are aware of copyright duration, let alone why it might matter. 

Education takes a while, though, and we just don’t have that long. How can we inspire immediate change?

<!— I’m not sure I make the case for education well at all. Instead I think I should make the claim that public perception is a key driver, and that we need to make changes in the sphere of the public consciousness, before we try to impose regulation or constraint on large systems. This angle also generalises to other issues, so it’s one to consider. —>

Regulation is tricky. In fact, not only is it tricky, but we consistently try and fail to fence in massive organisms — especially tech ones — with little success. So, given that the hippie movement became successful once it permeated the collective consciousness, perhaps we can engineer something similar for the purposes of improving the population’s understanding of the systems they exist inside.



## Constructing a successful movement

I'll admit: I'm not qualified to make observations about what has made movements successful in the past. However, here are some observations. 

It strikes me that we have a lot to learn from things like the civil rights movement, or environmentalism, or the suffragette movement before them both — these movements made lasting change.

Smaller movements did, too. "Motordom", for example, was a political movement which became responsible for the US and UK's culture of pedestrians being less important than cars on roads. Motordom was contested by other movements which were angled toward pedestrians being given priority; what made Motordom more effective? These are angles we should be investigating. I intend to.

Meanwhile, there are some things we can _certainly_ do. 

<!— edited to here —>

One angle is to take a leaf out of Clifford Stoll's proverbial book [Clifford Stoll's TED talk citation](https://www.ted.com/talks/clifford_stoll_on_everything), where he notes that he _"thinks locally, and acts locally"_. Keeping activism around a topic local and small means that the teaching can be:

* Tailored to the local community
* More intimate and personal
* More readily responsive to criticism
* Easy (and cheap!) to organise, compared to any kind of movement which is at scale by design

I'd argue that small local events can inspire other people, who can take enthusiasm for a topic to pastures new and inspire other people to carry their own local torch. Meanwhile, larger-scale discussions spring up too, in the form of things like articles and talks. An underground philosophy scene has proven effective for people such as Natalie Wynn and Olly Thorn to get their message across on YouTube, which might provide a platform for our own cultural changes. However, _we should do what we can, not what would be perfect in a perfect world_. Better to change ten people's minds in our own neighbourhood than not to change a thousand.

## More than enough really is too much

The point of this whole essay is this: when we see changes we want to make, they won’t happen unless we speak to real people, not just academics and experts. This change isn’t enough to change paradigms, but it’s a start. It’s also a requirement. Manifestos targeted to experts in the field they’re on are preaching to a choir in the most useless of ways, and if we don’t propose fixes to the issues we identify, we become a community of people who collectively pat each other on the back for pointing out some issue and then moving on. If the issue never gets communicated _outside_ of that group, it can’t be fixed, because the group isn’t capable of fixing it itself; all it’s capable of is patting itself on the back.

This is my concern. Academic communities are getting excellent at back-patting, but terrible at inspiring change. This isn’t an problem if we take advantage of the fact that there _are_ people out there who are very good at inspiring changes. However, it’s not nearly enough if we don’t make the communication to these groups of activists and world-changers. 

Typically the average person on the street isn’t going to have enough time to keep up with the discussions we have. When something important emerges from those discussions — like Joichi Ito’s conclusions in Resisting Reduction — it’s _critical_ that those conclusions are disseminated to the people who can do something about them. 

This is important for two reasons:

1. It means we can leave the let’s-fix-things aspect of the problem to people well-equipped to do so, which academics etc are not.
2. It means we can have more time to identify these issues, which academics are actually quite well-equipped to do, assuming they really are experts in their field and have time outside of teaching etc to perform meaningful research or thinking.

So, in a way, this is a manifesto against manifestos, but one which — at least — proposes fixes to the problems identified, and is communicated in a space where the right people might actually see it. I’m hopeful that the actions suggested in this article might actually ignite a conversation around how changes inspired by Ito’s manifesto are made, so that we can get the ball rolling on fixing the issue he lays out.

I hope they do, because more than enough really is too much, and it’s time we did something about that.
